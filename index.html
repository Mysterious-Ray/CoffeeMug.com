      <h2>🔥 Story 1: Vandana Luthra – Founder of VLCC</h2>
      <p>
        Vandana started VLCC in 1989 when wellness was barely a thing in India. People doubted her — a woman in business? In beauty? With just one center, she focused on health, fitness, and self-confidence. Slowly, her idea became a chain across India and even internationally. VLCC now offers wellness, skin care, and salon services across 300+ locations. Vandana faced tough competition and even tougher societal expectations — but her hustle, vision, and heart made her an icon. 💪🌟

      <h2>🌱 Story 2: Richa Kar – Founder of Zivame</h2>
      <p>
        Richa Kar broke all the “rules” when she launched Zivame — India’s first online lingerie store. People were awkward, investors were skeptical, and her parents were shocked. But she believed women deserved comfort, privacy, and confidence while shopping for essentials. She fought the stigma, educated users, and turned a bold idea into a bold brand. Today, Zivame is a household name and Richa is known for changing the way India shops. Her story is all about fearless focus and breaking taboos. 💃🩷

      <h2>👶 Story 3: Ghazal Alagh – Mamaearth Magic</h2>
      <p>
        When Ghazal became a mom, she wanted only safe and chemical-free products for her baby. But nothing fit the bill. So what did she do? She built her own brand — Mamaearth! It started in her kitchen with simple ideas, but today it’s one of the fastest-growing personal care companies in India. Ghazal faced rejections, financial stress, and product challenges. But she stayed consistent, creative, and customer-focused. From Shark Tank fame to market queen — she proved that real love can create real businesses. 🧼👶🌿
